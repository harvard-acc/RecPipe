## Notes

1. Before running anything, move the extracted indices of the target dataset (i.e., `indices_lookup_small.npy` to this folder.

2. `lru.py` simulates cache configurations of different capacities and ratios between stages on the extracted indices. Parsed results should automatically appear in the `results` subdirectory.

3. To analyze and plot the results in `results` go back to the root directory and check out `plotting/figure10c`.
